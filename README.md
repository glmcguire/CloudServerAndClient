# CloudServerAndClient

This is a multithreaded cloud server with a client, GUI included, to connect. As of the moment, it only supports downloading files from the server to the client, as it was written mainly to test my knowledge of multithreading, sockets, AWT/Swing, DOM, as well as input and output steams. As of now, it has been tested and works with transferring text, png, xml, and even mp4 files.

To use:

Run MultiTheadedServer.java then followed by ServerGUI.java.



Included below is a sample image of the client GUI.

Note: The server box on the left hand side is more of a development convienence... Allowing for the user to monitor the files contained in the server. Ideally, the client would only include 'Available Files' and 'Downloaded Files' while the 'Server Files' would be in its own GUI for the server.
